These data come from RNA-seq data aligned to *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and represent counts of reads inferring alternative splicing events versus the amount of reads that come from constitutive splicing at that junction from three biological replicates. The analysis script documents all the data filtering and analyses for this paper.
